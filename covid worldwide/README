### SQL QUERIES


DESCRIPTION:
This project is an SQL analysis of the COVID-19 worldwide dataset, which contains information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recovered worldwide. The dataset was sourced from kaggle.

The COVID-19 worldwide dataset contains the following columns:
country
total cases
total deaths 
total recovered 
active cases 
total tests
population



Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of SQL in analyzing a real-world dataset. I explored the COVID-19 worldwide dataset and answered several questions using SQL queries, such as identifying the countries with the highest number of cases, deaths, and recovered.   Through SQL queries, I  gained insights into the COVID-19 pandemic and how it has impacted different countries around the world.
